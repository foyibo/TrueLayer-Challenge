#Name the two main Linux Families

By families I'm assumming distros, that is the two main widely used Linux distributions.

As we know Linux started as an open source project, that has evolved and matured our time.
In my view, the two main families or distros which are so called because of their 
package management system are: deb and rpm. 

Debian based Linux families - Debian, Ubuntu (and all it's variant), Linux Mint, etc. 
they all use the (Advance Package Tool) APT for software and application management and 
the usually have the .deb extensions

While

Red Hat Linux - Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, Arch Linux, etc.
uses (RedHat Package Management) RPM and yum tools, usually with the .rpm extensions.

But there are many forks and variants of Linux in use today, these derivatives are 
all based off the main linux kernel.
